# sequenceDefinitionMap: (NotRequired - Default map:{})
#
# The relation mappings between sequence and table.
# If you don't specify the mappings, you cannot insert 
# a record of the table by sequence.
# The table names are treated as case insensitive.
#
# Example:
# map:{
#     ; PURCHASE     = SEQ_PURCHASE
#     ; MEMBER       = SEQ_MEMBER
#     ; MEMBER_LOGIN = SEQ_MEMBER_LOGIN
#     ; PRODUCT      = SEQ_PRODUCT
# }
#
# *The line that starts with '#' means comment-out.
